- I visited loveable at the very beginning before even start working on this website. The purpose was to get ideas about how these portfolios are being build, to be honest I got noting appealing to be considered, so I just dismissed it.
- I used ChatGPT to know what to include in .gitignore file.
- I asked ChatGPT this question "what can I do if I have js file contains constants and I want to use it in another js file ? " The thing I was missing is the export keyword before declaring the array statistics. I face this error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module (at script.js:23:1)", I asked ChatGPT about it. It explained to me what I should do and why, to make the story short, it said add type attribute and set it to module for the main js file. Also it didn't work, it asked me again to use live server and I downloaded npx live-server but still the same error "script.js:23  GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/js/constants net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)". Finally the problem was because I didn't write the extension .js in the import statement in the main.js. What I learned is that indeed I need to use module as a type attribute int the script link in the html file, however I don't need npx live-server. Latter on I decided to change what I'm thinking about and I deleted the constants.js file.
- Another thing that I know but forgot how to use is the containers, I asked ChatGPT to explain and provide some useful practical examples to help me refresh my memory and apply this to this website.
- Also I was struggling with the alignment of the input elements in the contact section, after some discussions it became clear that inputs are block elements by default so to change the size in order to make it responsive, these inputs must be either flex or inline-block. 
I didn't know how to implement the arrow in the main page that will take me to the about me page, so I asked ChatGPT about it, it responded with using top: window.innerHeight in the js code when clicking.
